1- Assuming you are aware of how to play around with Python interpreter.
REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop - good for quick checks and experiments.
Also good for quckly handling support queries. Not scalable for development
of even moderate complexity.

2- Modularity - provides cognitive simplification, which in turn allows for 
scalability i.e. ability to add more and more features to the system.

3- Modularity can be hierarchical -
    packages
        sub-pacakges
            .
                .
                    files
                        definitions in a file
    definitions consist of variable definitions, function definitions, 
    user defined class definitions.
    package + file level hierarchy element is called a module in Python.
    
4- definitions in a module can be imported by other modules
    - selectively some of them
    - or all of the definitions in one shot.
